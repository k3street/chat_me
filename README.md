NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3003
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here

# Optional: For enhanced features
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

### Basic Chat
- Simply type your robot building questions in the chat interface
- The AI will provide detailed, technical answers about hardware, software, and assembly

### Voice Interaction
- Click the microphone button (ðŸŽ¤) to record your question
- The AI will transcribe your speech and provide both text and audio responses
- Toggle "Voice Mode" in the header for continuous voice conversations
- Supports OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text and TTS for audio responses

### Document Upload
- Click the upload button (ðŸ“Ž) to upload relevant documents
- Supported formats: PDF, TXT, DOC, DOCX
- The AI will use document content to enhance its responses

### YouTube Integration
- Click the YouTube button (ðŸŽ¥) to add video transcripts
- Enter a YouTube URL with captions
