# Robot Building Chat Agent

A React-based web chat agent application built with Next.js and TypeScript, designed to answer technical questions about building robots using OpenAI's GPT-4 with document processing and vector search capabilities.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chat**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to answer technical questions about robot building
- **Voice Interaction**: Speech-to-text input and text-to-speech responses using OpenAI's Whisper and TTS
- **Voice Mode**: Toggle continuous voice conversation mode
- **Document Upload**: Upload PDF, TXT, DOC, and DOCX files to enhance the AI's knowledge base
- **YouTube Integration**: Extract and process YouTube video transcripts for additional context
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search through uploaded documents and video transcripts
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive chat interface with message history
