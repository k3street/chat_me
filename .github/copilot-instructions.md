## Project Overview
This is a React-based web chat agent application built with Next.js and TypeScript. The application is designed to answer technical questions about building robots using:
- OpenAI Agents SDK for AI-powered responses
- Document processing and vector search capabilities
- YouTube content integration
- Modern responsive chat interface

## Key Technologies
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** for AI functionality
- **Vector search** for document and content processing

## Code Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Follow React best practices with functional components and hooks
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Maintain clean separation between UI components and business logic
- Implement proper type definitions for all API responses and data structures

## Chat Agent Specific Features
- Real-time chat interface with message history
- Document upload and processing capabilities
- YouTube video content integration
- Vector-based similarity search for relevant content
- Context-aware responses about robotics and technical topics
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

## Architecture Patterns
- Server-side API routes for backend functionality
- Client-side components for interactive UI
- Proper state management for chat functionality
- Integration with OpenAI APIs through the Agents SDK
- Vector database integration for semantic search
